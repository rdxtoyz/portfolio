## click me, you gonna lics it 👇

aight so listen up real quick no cap 🫠

this ain't your boring template portfolio bro. i built this whole thing from scratch with **Nuxt 4** and it goes stupid hard. like actually lics fr fr.

### what's inside this bad boy

- **Nuxt 4** yeah the latest one, not that old stuff
- **Vue 3** with `<script setup>` clean af composables no cap
- **SCSS** custom design tokens, mixins, the whole drip 🎨
- **GitHub API** pulls my repos live, auto sorts by stars, language colors n everything
- **BlogVerse API** my blogs load straight from [blogverse](https://github.com/nayandas69/blogverse), you lics that too if you fw blogs
- **Vitest** tests? yeah i got those too, don't sleep on me 😤
- **Vercel** deployed and buttery smooth

### how it works tho

so basically two composables do the heavy lifting:

- `useGithubRepos` hits the github api, grabs my pinned repos, shows stars forks languages all that good stuff
- `useBlogPosts` pulls my latest articles from blogverse api (`https://blogverse-five-omega.vercel.app/api/v1`) so the blog section stays fresh without me touching a thing

the whole ui is component based `AppHeader`, `AppFooter`, `ProjectCard`, `ProjectsSection`, `ArticlesSection` everything modular and clean. icon components for github, x, discord, mail, all custom svg no library bloat.

### the scss drip

nah fr the styling is lowkey fire. got scss variables for colors, spacing, fonts — dark mode vibes with `#0D0D0D` background and that cyan `#00E5FF` accent hittin different. responsive mixins so it looks clean on your phone too bestie.

### wanna run it locally?

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

that's literally it. open `localhost:3000` and vibe.

### wanna test?

```bash
pnpm test
```

vitest handles it, we good.

### wanna dockerize it?

build the image:
```bash
docker build -t nayan-portfolio .
```

run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 nayan-portfolio  #run the container and map port 3000
```

the docker will start the lics server and you can access the portfolio at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. easy peasy.

### wanna read more?

i wrote a whole detailed blog post about how i built this thing — check it on my [BlogVerse](https://blogverse-five-omega.vercel.app/blog/building-my-developer-portfolio-with-nuxt-4) when it drops. or just fork [blogverse](https://github.com/nayandas69/blogverse) and start your own blog, it's all open source baby 🤙

### lics or no lics?

if you made it this far you already lics it. smash that star ⭐ and bounce or stick around and contribute idc both valid 💯
